def generate_project_plan(idea: str):
    prompt = f"""
    Given this project idea: "{idea}"

    Create a structured, AMBITIOUS MVP development plan that will result in an impressive, polished demo.
    The plan must be in strict JSON format with these keys:

    {{
      "title": "short, catchy project name (2-4 words, like 'Snake Challenge' or 'Calorie Tracker Pro')",
      "description": "short summary of the program",
      "features": ["list of 7-12 core features - be generous with feature count"],
      "ui_polish": ["list of 3-5 visual enhancements: animations, transitions, particle effects, visual feedback, color schemes, hover states, etc."],
      "steps": ["detailed step-by-step instructions to implement ALL features and polish"],
      "dependencies": ["list of required libraries"]
    }}

  Rules:
  - If it's a GAME:
    * The game must be procedural and endlessly replayable (not story-driven or choice-based).
    * The game must have clear objectives, visible scoring, and a loss condition.
    * The game must increase difficulty as time or score progresses (e.g., speed, spawn rate, or challenge scaling).
    * The game must track and display both current score and a persistent high score (use localStorage for web apps).
    * The game must have a main menu screen with options (Start Game, View Instructions, etc.).
    * The game must ALWAYS include a "Return to Main Menu" button accessible during gameplay and game-over.
    * The game must restart cleanly after a game-over with smooth transitions.
    * STRONGLY prefer Web-based (HTML/JS) for games unless it requires complex physics or 3D.
    * Include power-ups, obstacles, or variety to prevent monotony.
    * Add visual juice: particle effects on events, screen shake, smooth animations, score pop-ups, color changes.
    * Avoid narrative text adventures, quizzes, or branching-choice games‚Äîfocus on mechanical gameplay.

  - If it's a FUNCTIONAL TOOL/PROGRAM:
    * Must solve a real, specific problem mentioned or implied in the Reddit post.
    * Must have a complete, intuitive UI with clear instructions.
    * Should include data persistence (localStorage), input validation, error handling.
    * Must provide immediate visual feedback for all user actions.
    * Add helpful features: export data, reset functionality, tooltips, examples.
    * Make it USEFUL and COMPLETE, not just a proof-of-concept.
    * Prefer Web apps (HTML/JS) for accessibility - anyone can open a browser.

  - If it's a WEB APP (PREFERRED):
    * Must output static files: index.html, style.css, script.js.
    * Must be runnable locally by opening index.html in a browser (no servers or frameworks).
    * Use CSS animations, transitions, and hover effects generously.
    * Ensure responsive behavior within a container (don't worry about mobile).
    * Add loading states, success/error messages, and visual feedback.
    * Use localStorage for any data persistence needs.

  - AMBITION LEVEL:
    * Aim for 8-10 features minimum - think "impressive portfolio piece" not "hello world".
    * Every interaction should have visual feedback.
    * Include edge case handling in the steps.
    * Make it feel polished and complete, not bare-bones.

  - CRITICAL JSON RULES:
    * Use double quotes for all JSON strings, never single quotes.
    * Avoid backslash escapes in JSON string values - use plain apostrophes instead.
    * If you need an apostrophe in text, just use it directly (e.g., "I'm" not "I\'m").
    * Keep all content within JSON values simple and avoid special characters that need escaping.
    * Do not include code examples with quotes/escapes inside JSON string values.

  - Always prefer WEB APPS over Python unless the concept fundamentally requires a different medium.
  - Do NOT create vague demos or incomplete apps.
  - Output structured JSON only‚Äîno explanations or commentary.
