# A 2D game where the player controls a character attempting to navigate a grid-based bathroom floor covered in persistent lube spills, causing uncontrollable sliding and a 'game over' upon hitting obstacles or falling off the map.

A 2D grid-based Pygame where the player controls a character sliding uncontrollably across a lube-covered bathroom floor. The goal is to reach an exit tile without hitting obstacles or falling off the map.

## Features
- Grid-based movement with persistent sliding in one direction until stopped.
- Player character (simple square).
- Static game map with start, exit, and obstacle tiles.
- Collision detection with obstacles and map boundaries.
- Game Over condition upon hitting an obstacle or falling off the map.
- Win condition upon reaching the exit tile.
- Restart mechanism for new game sessions.
- Basic Pygame rendering of grid, player, and status messages.

## How to Run
- Run with: `python main.py`

## Controls / Inputs
