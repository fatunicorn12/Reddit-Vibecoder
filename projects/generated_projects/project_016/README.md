# A static web game called "Neighborhood Peeker" where players attempt to discreetly observe virtual neighbors in their hot tub to earn points, but must quickly hide to avoid getting caught and triggering a game over.

- Player controls (click/tap) to toggle between peeking and hiding states.
- Score accumulation while the player is in the 'peeking' state.
- Randomized 'neighbor looking up' events that serve as the detection mechanic.
- Game over condition if the player is peeking when the neighbor looks up.
- Display of current score.
