# Develop a simple 2D game called "Personal Space Dash" where the player navigates a character through a stream of randomly moving abstract entities, aiming to survive as long as possible by preventing any entity from entering their immediate personal space.

A simple 2D Pygame arcade game where the player controls a central character, avoiding randomly moving abstract entities. The objective is to survive as long as possible by preventing any entity from entering the character's immediate personal space, earning points based on time survived.

## Features
- Player character controlled by keyboard (WASD or arrow keys).
- Stream of randomly generated and moving abstract entities.
- Collision detection: game ends if an entity touches the player's defined 'personal space'.
- Score tracking: displays the time (in seconds) the player has survived.
- Game Over screen with an option to restart the game.
- Basic graphical representation of player, entities, and score.

## How to Run
- Run with: `python main.py`

## Controls / Inputs
