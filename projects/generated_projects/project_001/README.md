# Create a rhythm game where players perfectly time a miniature virtual guillotine to chop fruit for a juice bar.

A console-based rhythm game MVP where a miniature virtual guillotine automatically 'chops' fruit. The game simulates timing accuracy for each chop and provides a score based on performance over a short demo period, then exits.

## Features
- Automatic, timed fruit appearance based on a rhythmic beat.
- Simulated guillotine chop event with randomized timing accuracy (perfect, early, late).
- Scoring system that awards points based on chop accuracy.
- Console output for real-time game events (fruit appearing, chop outcome, score updates).
- Automatic demo mode that runs for a fixed duration (e.g., 5-10 seconds).
- Final summary displaying total score, perfect chops, and missed chops.
