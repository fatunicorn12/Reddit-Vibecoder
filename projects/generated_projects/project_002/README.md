# A game where you manage a stressed-out digital employee, trying to complete two people's work for 10 days while deflecting "boss attacks."

A simple Pygame where the player manages a digital employee by dodging 'boss attacks' to prevent their stress meter from overflowing. The objective is to survive as long as possible, measured in 'days worked', before the employee succumbs to stress.

## Features
- Player-controlled employee character (rectangle) moving horizontally.
- Falling 'boss attack' obstacles (red rectangles) that increase stress on collision.
- Visible stress meter that fills up.
- Game over condition when stress meter is full.
- Score tracking representing 'days worked' (based on survival time).
- Increasing difficulty over time (faster/more boss attacks).
- Restartable gameplay after game over.
