  "description": "A simple console-based program designed to help users quickly prepare for competitive exams. It presents rapid-fire, multiple-choice questions, provides immediate feedback on answers, and displays a final score.",
  "features": [
    "Loads a predefined set of multiple-choice questions.",
    "Presents questions one by one with numbered options.",
    "Accepts user input for their answer choice.",
    "Provides immediate feedback (correct/incorrect) after each answer.",
    "Tracks the user's score throughout the quiz.",
    "Displays the final score at the end of the quiz session."
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Define a list of dictionaries to store quiz questions. Each dictionary should contain keys for 'question' (string), 'options' (list of strings), and 'correct_answer' (the 0-based index of the correct option within the 'options' list).",
    "Initialize a `score` variable to 0 and a `total_questions` variable based on the length of the questions list.",
    "Start a main loop that iterates through each question in the defined quiz data.",
    "Inside the loop, display the current question text clearly.",
    "Iterate through the 'options' list for the current question and print each option prefixed with a number (e.g., '1. Option A').",
    "Prompt the user to enter the number corresponding to their chosen answer.",
    "Implement input validation to ensure the user's input is a valid integer within the range of available options. Re-prompt if the input is invalid.",
    "Convert the user's 1-based input to a 0-based index.",
    "Compare the user's chosen index with the 'correct_answer' index for the current question.",
    "Provide immediate feedback: If correct, print 'Correct!' and increment the `score`. If incorrect, print 'Incorrect. The correct answer was [correct option text].'",
    "After the loop finishes (all questions answered), print the final `score` along with the `total_questions` (e.g., 'You scored X out of Y questions.')."
