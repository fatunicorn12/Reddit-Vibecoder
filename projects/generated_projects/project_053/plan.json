  "steps": [
    "1. **Project Setup & Basic HTML Structure:** Create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. Set up a basic HTML layout including a header, a main content display area, and a control panel for buttons (Next Grin, Favorite, Share, View Favorites, Add Grin). Link CSS and JS files.",
    "2. **Base CSS Styling:** Apply a CSS reset. Style the main container, centering content. Define a pleasant, cheerful color palette and typography. Implement initial responsive adjustments for the main content area using `max-width` and `padding`.",
    "3. **Curated Content Data & Initial Display Logic:** In `script.js`, create a `curatedContent` array containing URLs of funny GIFs (e.g., `.gif` extension) and short videos (e.g., `.mp4`, `.webm`). Implement a `displayRandomContent()` function to: a) Select a random URL. b) Dynamically create an `<img>` element for GIFs or a `<video>` element for videos (setting `autoplay`, `loop`, `muted`, `controls` for video). c) Append the new element to the content display area, replacing any previous content. d) Call `displayRandomContent()` on page load.",
    "4. **'Next Grin' Button & Event Listener:** Add a 'Next Grin' button in `index.html`. Attach an event listener in `script.js` to this button that calls `displayRandomContent()` when clicked.",
    "5. **Loading State & Themed Animation (Feature & Polish):** Add a `div` for a custom loading indicator (e.g., a simple bouncing 'grin' emoji or custom SVG) to `index.html`. Style it with CSS keyframe animations. In `script.js`, show this loading indicator *before* fetching/creating content and hide it once the `load` event fires on the `<img>` or `<video>` element. Implement CSS transitions for its appearance/disappearance.",
    "6. **'Favorite' Content with LocalStorage (Feature & Polish):** Add a 'Favorite' button (e.g., a heart icon) to `index.html`. In `script.js`, create functions: `getFavorites()`, `saveFavorites(favoritesArray)`, `addFavorite(url)`, `removeFavorite(url)`, and `isFavorited(url)`, all interacting with `localStorage`. Implement `toggleFavorite()`: on button click, add or remove the current content's URL from `localStorage`. Visually update the button's state (e.g., filled vs. outline heart, and trigger the 'Favorite' Confirmation Visuals animation) immediately. When new content loads, update the favorite button's state based on `isFavorited()`.",
    "7. **Favorites Gallery Modal (Feature):** Add a 'View Favorites' button to `index.html`. Create a hidden modal structure (overlay `div` and content `div`) in `index.html` to display favorited items. Style the modal with CSS for a clean, accessible overlay. In `script.js`, implement `renderFavoritesGallery()`: retrieve all favorites from `localStorage`, create small thumbnail elements for each, and populate the modal. Add click listeners to these thumbnails to display that specific content in the main viewer. Include a 'Remove from Favorites' button on each item within the gallery and a close button for the modal.",
    "8. **Content Sharing (Feature):** Add a 'Share' button to `index.html`. In `script.js`, implement `copyToClipboard(text)` using `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`. Attach an event listener to the 'Share' button to copy the current content's URL. Provide temporary visual feedback, such as a small 'Copied!' message that fades out after a few seconds.",
    "9. **User-Submitted Content (Feature):** Add an input field for URLs and an 'Add Your Grin' button to `index.html`. In `script.js`, create a `userGrins` array in `localStorage` and functions to `addUserGrin(url)` and `clearUserGrins()`. Implement input validation (basic URL format, check for image/video extensions if possible) and display feedback for success or failure. Combine `userGrins` with `curatedContent` when `displayRandomContent()` fetches a random URL. Add a button to clear user-submitted content.",
    "10. **Robust Error Handling (Feature):** Attach an `onerror` event listener to the dynamically created `<img>` and `<video>` elements. If an error occurs (e.g., content fails to load), replace the content area with a fallback 'Grin broke! Try another?' message, a generic 'error' GIF, and automatically load the next random grin after a short delay.",
    "11. **Responsive Layout Refinements (Polish):** Enhance CSS for responsiveness, ensuring content scales correctly (`object-fit: contain;` for media) and buttons/UI elements are well-spaced and readable across various container sizes without relying on full mobile media queries for this MVP. Use `flex-wrap` for control panel buttons.",
    "12. **Final UI Polish Integrations (Polish):**\n    *   **Smooth Content Transition:** Apply CSS `transition` properties to the content container's `opacity` and `transform` (e.g., `scale`) when a new content element is added or removed. Use JavaScript to add/remove classes that trigger these animations.\n    *   **Interactive Button Feedback:** Ensure all buttons have `transition` properties on their `background-color`, `box-shadow`, and `transform` for smooth `hover` and `active` states.\n    *   **'Favorite' Confirmation Visuals:** Refine the heart icon animation with CSS keyframes (e.g., a quick pulse, size change, or color fill transition). For advanced polish, consider a lightweight particle function in JS (if CSS isn't sufficient for desired effect) on favorite click.\n    *   **Dynamic Background Shifts:** Implement a JavaScript function that, upon each new content load, subtly updates a CSS variable for `background-color` or applies a new class to the `body` or main wrapper, triggering a smooth `transition` to a new, harmonizing color or gradient."
